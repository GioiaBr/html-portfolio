<h1>About Me</h1> 
<p>Hey, everyone! I'm Gioia, 

<p>an aspiring <strong>Web Developer</strong>  and <strong>UX Designer</strong> with a passion for crafting digital experiences 
  that resonate with users. Currently, I'm on an exciting journey of self-teaching while diving into the 
  world of technology and <strong>design</strong>. Balancing this with a <strong>full-time role at a software company</strong>, I'm constantly
 immersed in real-world projects that challenge and inspire me.</p>

<p>I'm eager to expand my skills and knowledge, which is why I've embarked on a <strong> Bachelor of Science</strong>  in
   "UX Design & Digital Solutions." This academic pursuit complements my practical experience, providing
  me with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and practices that underpin exceptional user experiences.</p>
<p>Beyond the realm of programming and tech, I find joy in the simple pleasures of life. 
You might catch me <strong>knitting away </strong>a new creation, hitting the <strong>gym</strong>  for a refreshing 
workout session, or simply unwinding by the river, marveling at the <strong>shimmering</strong> lights
 of my city.</p>
